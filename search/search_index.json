For histopathologic confirmation, thrombosis should be present without significant evidence of inflammation in the vessel wall 2. Pregnancy morbidity a. One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, with normal fetal morphology documented by ultrasound or by direct examination of the fetus; or b. One or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of: (i) eclampsia or severe preeclampsia defined according to standard definitions, or (ii) recognized features of placental insufficiency\u00a7; or c. Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation, with maternal anatomic or hormonal abnormalities and paternal and maternal chromosomal causes excluded. In studies of populations of patients who have more than one type of pregnancy morbidity, investigators are strongly encouraged to stratify groups of subjects according to a, b, or c above. Laboratory criteria\u00a5 1. LA present in plasma, on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart, detected according to the guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Scientific Subcommittee on LAs/phospholipid-dependent antibodies). 2. aCL of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma, present in medium or high titer (ie, >40 GPL or MPL, or >the 99th percentile), on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA. 3. Anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma (in titer >the 99th percentile), present on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA, according to recommended procedures. * Classification of APS should be avoided if less than 12 weeks or more than five years separate the positive aPL test and the clinical manifestation. \u00b6 Coexisting inherited or acquired factors for thrombosis are not reasons for excluding patients from APS trials. However, two subgroups of APS patients should be recognized, according to: (a) the presence; and (b) the absence of additional risk factors for thrombosis. Indicative (but not exhaustive) cases include: age (>55 in men and >65 in women) and the presence of any of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, body mass index \u226530 kg m\u20132, microalbuminuria, estimated GFR <60 mL minute\u20131), inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy, immobilization, and surgery. Thus, patients who fulfill criteria should be stratified according to contributing causes of thrombosis. \u0394 A thrombotic episode in the past could be considered as a clinical criterion, provided that thrombosis is proved by appropriate diagnostic means and that no alternative diagnosis or cause of thrombosis is found. \u25ca Superficial venous thrombosis is not included in the clinical criteria. \u00a7 Generally accepted features of placental insufficiency include: (i) abnormal or non-reassuring fetal surveillance test(s), eg, a non-reactive non-stress test, suggestive of fetal hypoxemia; (ii) abnormal Doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis suggestive of fetal hypoxemia, eg, absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery; (iii) oligohydramnios, eg, an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less; or (iv) a postnatal birth weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age. \u00a5 Investigators are strongly advised to classify APS patients in studies into one of the following categories: I, more than one laboratory criteria present (any combination); IIa, LA present alone; IIb, aCL antibody present alone; IIc, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody present alone. Rheumatoid arthritis 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who 1. Have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)* 2. With the synovitis not better explained by another disease\u2020 Classification criteria for RA (score-based algorithm: add score of categories A\u2013D; a score of \u22656 of 10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite RA)\u2021 Score A.

Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)\u2021\u2021 Normal CRP and normal ESR 0 Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR 1 D. Duration of symptoms\u00a7\u00a7 <6 weeks 0 \u22656 weeks 1 *The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. \u2020Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted. \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. **In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. When rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low positive for RF. \u2021\u2021Normal and abnormal are determined by local laboratory standards. \u00a7\u00a7Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment regardless of treatment status. 1987 ACR (formerly ARA) classification criteria Criterion Description Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least one hour before maximal improvement. Arthritis of three or more joint areas At least three joint areas (out of 14 possible areas; right or left PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP joints) simultaneously have had soft tissue swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) as observed by a physician. Arthritis of hand joints At least one area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint. Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined above) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs, without absolute symmetry is acceptable). Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences or extensor surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions as observed by a physician. Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method for which the result has been positive in less than 5 percent of normal control subjects. Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid arthritis on posteroanterior hand or wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification localised in, or most marked adjacent to, the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify). Note: For classification purposes, a patient has RA if at least four of these criteria are satisfied (the first four must have been present for at least six weeks). Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 2019 ACR/EULAR classification criteria The entry criterion is necessary to classify SLE. ANA at a titer of \u22651:80 on HEp-2 cells or an equivalent positive test (ever).* At least 1 clinical criterion required to classify SLE. Additional additive (clinical or immunology) criteria are counted toward the total score : \u00b6 Do not count a criterion if there is a more likely explanation than SLE. Occurrence of a criterion on \u22651 occasion is sufficient. Criteria need not occur simultaneously. Within each domain (eg, mucocutaneous, complement proteins), only the highest-weighted criterion is counted toward the total score if more than 1 is present.

The classification is based upon 11 criteria. For the purpose of identifying patients in clinical studies, a person is said to have SLE if any 4 or more of the 11 criteria are present, serially or simultaneously, during any interval of observation. \u00b6 For the SLICC criteria, criteria are cumulative and need not be presently concurrently. A patient is classified as having SLE if he or she satisfies 4 of the clinical and immunologic criteria used in the SLICC classification criteria, including at least 1 clinical criterion and 1 immunologic criterion. \u0394 Alternatively, according to the SLICC criteria, a patient is classified as having SLE if he or she has biopsy-proven nephritis compatible with SLE in the presence of ANAs or anti-dsDNA antibodies. Sjogren syndrome 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for primary Sjogren syndrome The classification of primary SS applies to any individual who meets the inclusion criteria\u00a7, does not have any of the conditions listed as exclusion criteria\u00a5, and has a score \u22654 when the weights from the five criteria items are summed.

One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, with normal fetal morphology documented by ultrasound or by direct examination of the fetus; or b. One or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of: (i) eclampsia or severe preeclampsia defined according to standard definitions, or (ii) recognized features of placental insufficiency\u00a7; or c. Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation, with maternal anatomic or hormonal abnormalities and paternal and maternal chromosomal causes excluded. In studies of populations of patients who have more than one type of pregnancy morbidity, investigators are strongly encouraged to stratify groups of subjects according to a, b, or c above. Laboratory criteria\u00a5 1. LA present in plasma, on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart, detected according to the guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Scientific Subcommittee on LAs/phospholipid-dependent antibodies). 2. aCL of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma, present in medium or high titer (ie, >40 GPL or MPL, or >the 99th percentile), on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA. 3. Anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma (in titer >the 99th percentile), present on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA, according to recommended procedures. * Classification of APS should be avoided if less than 12 weeks or more than five years separate the positive aPL test and the clinical manifestation. \u00b6 Coexisting inherited or acquired factors for thrombosis are not reasons for excluding patients from APS trials. However, two subgroups of APS patients should be recognized, according to: (a) the presence; and (b) the absence of additional risk factors for thrombosis. Indicative (but not exhaustive) cases include: age (>55 in men and >65 in women) and the presence of any of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, body mass index \u226530 kg m\u20132, microalbuminuria, estimated GFR <60 mL minute\u20131), inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy, immobilization, and surgery. Thus, patients who fulfill criteria should be stratified according to contributing causes of thrombosis. \u0394 A thrombotic episode in the past could be considered as a clinical criterion, provided that thrombosis is proved by appropriate diagnostic means and that no alternative diagnosis or cause of thrombosis is found. \u25ca Superficial venous thrombosis is not included in the clinical criteria. \u00a7 Generally accepted features of placental insufficiency include: (i) abnormal or non-reassuring fetal surveillance test(s), eg, a non-reactive non-stress test, suggestive of fetal hypoxemia; (ii) abnormal Doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis suggestive of fetal hypoxemia, eg, absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery; (iii) oligohydramnios, eg, an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less; or (iv) a postnatal birth weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age. \u00a5 Investigators are strongly advised to classify APS patients in studies into one of the following categories: I, more than one laboratory criteria present (any combination); IIa, LA present alone; IIb, aCL antibody present alone; IIc, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody present alone.","title":"Revised Antiphospholipid Syndrome 5"},{"location":"intro/criteria/#rheumatoid-arthritis","text":"","title":"Rheumatoid arthritis"},{"location":"intro/criteria/#2010-acreular-classification-criteria","text":"Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who 1.

Duration of symptoms\u00a7\u00a7 <6 weeks 0 \u22656 weeks 1 \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. **In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. When rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low positive for RF. \u2021\u2021Normal and abnormal are determined by local laboratory standards. \u00a7\u00a7Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment regardless of treatment status.

Ann Rheum Dis. 2010;69(9):1580-1588. [20699241] For classification purposes, a patient has RA if at least four of these criteria are satisfied (the first four must have been present for at least six weeks). Criterion Description Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least one hour before maximal improvement. Arthritis of three or more joint areas At least three joint areas (out of 14 possible areas; right or left PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP joints) simultaneously have had soft tissue swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) as observed by a physician. Arthritis of hand joints At least one area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint. Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined above) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs, without absolute symmetry is acceptable). Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences or extensor surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions as observed by a physician. Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method for which the result has been positive in less than 5 percent of normal control subjects. Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid arthritis on posteroanterior hand or wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification localised in, or most marked adjacent to, the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify).

Criterion Definition Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least one hour before maximal improvement. Arthritis of three or more joint areas At least three joint areas (out of 14 possible areas; right or left PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP joints) simultaneously have had soft tissue swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) as observed by a physician. Arthritis of hand joints At least one area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint. Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined above) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs, without absolute symmetry is acceptable). Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences or extensor surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions as observed by a physician. Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method for which the result has been positive in less than 5 percent of normal control subjects. Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid arthritis on posteroanterior hand or wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification localised in, or most marked adjacent to, the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify). \ubd84\ub958\ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud658\uc790\uac00 RA\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc774 \uae30\uc900 \uc911 \ucd5c\uc18c 4\uac1c\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.

Have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) 2. With the synovitis not better explained by another disease\u2020 Note The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. \u2020Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted. ACR/EULAR Classification criteria for RA A. Joint involvement\u00a7 Score 1 large joint\u2225 0 2\u201310 large joints 1 1\u20133 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)\u00b6 2 4\u201310 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 3 >10 joints (at least 1 small joint) 5 B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)\u2020\u2020 Score Negative RF and negative ACPA 0 Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA 2 High-positive RF or high-positive ACPA 3 C. Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)\u2021\u2021 Score Normal CRP and normal ESR 0 Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR 2 D. Duration of symptoms\u00a7\u00a7 Score <6 weeks 0 \u22656 weeks 1 Note \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. When rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low positive for RF. \u2021\u2021Normal and abnormal are determined by local laboratory standards. \u00a7\u00a7Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment regardless of treatment status. \ub300\uc0c1 \uc9d1\ub2e8(\ub204\uac00 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\uae4c?): \ud658\uc790\ub4e4 \uc911 1. \uc801\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uad00\uc808\uc5d0 \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud65c\ub9c9\uc5fc(\uc885\ucc3d)\uc774 \uc788\uc74c 2. \ub2e4\ub978 \uc9c8\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc798 \uc124\uba85\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud65c\ub9c9\uc5fc\u2020 Note \uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c \ub0b4\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud658\uc790\uac00 \ub958\ub9c8\ud2f0\uc2a4\uad00\uc808\uc5fc(RA)\uc758 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uace8\ubbf8\ub780\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba74\uc11c 2010\ub144 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ubcd1\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4\uba74 RA\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud658\uc790\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30\uac04 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc774 \ube44\ud65c\uc131(\uce58\ub8cc \uc720\ubb34\uc5d0 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774)\uc778 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec, \ud6c4\ud5a5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 2010\ub144 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud55c \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\ub3c4 RA\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \u2020\uac10\ubcc4 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc99d\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uc804\uc2e0\uc131 \ud64d\ubc18\uc131 \ub8e8\ud478\uc2a4, \uac74\uc120\uc131 \uad00\uc808\uc5fc \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud48d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc9c8\ud658\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uac10\ubcc4\uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub958\ub9c8\ud2f0\uc2a4\uc804\ubb38\uc758\uc640 \uc0c1\uc758\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud658\uc790\uac00 \uba85\ud655\ud55c RA\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 10\uc810 \uc911 6\uc810 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.

Criterion Definition Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least one hour before maximal improvement. Arthritis of three or more joint areas At least three joint areas (out of 14 possible areas; right or left PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP joints) simultaneously have had soft tissue swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) as observed by a physician. Arthritis of hand joints At least one area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint. Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined above) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs, without absolute symmetry is acceptable). Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences or extensor surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions as observed by a physician. Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method for which the result has been positive in less than 5 percent of normal control subjects. Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid arthritis on posteroanterior hand or wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification localised in, or most marked adjacent to, the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify). \ubd84\ub958\ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud658\uc790\uac00 RA\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc774 \uae30\uc900 \uc911 \ucd5c\uc18c 4\uac1c\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.

Have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) 2. With the synovitis not better explained by another disease\u2020 Note The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. \u2020Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted. ACR/EULAR Classification criteria for RA A. Joint involvement\u00a7 Score 1 large joint\u2225 0 2\u201310 large joints 1 1\u20133 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)\u00b6 2 4\u201310 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 3 >10 joints (at least 1 small joint) 5 B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)\u2020\u2020 Score Negative RF and negative ACPA 0 Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA 2 High-positive RF or high-positive ACPA 3 C. Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)\u2021\u2021 Score Normal CRP and normal ESR 0 Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR 2 D. Duration of symptoms\u00a7\u00a7 Score <6 weeks 0 \u22656 weeks 1 Note \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. When rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low positive for RF. \u2021\u2021Normal and abnormal are determined by local laboratory standards. \u00a7\u00a7Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment regardless of treatment status. \ub300\uc0c1 \uc9d1\ub2e8(\ub204\uac00 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\uae4c?): \ud658\uc790\ub4e4 \uc911 1. \uc801\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uad00\uc808\uc5d0 \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud65c\ub9c9\uc5fc(\uc885\ucc3d)\uc774 \uc788\uc74c 2. \ub2e4\ub978 \uc9c8\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc798 \uc124\uba85\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud65c\ub9c9\uc5fc\u2020 Note \uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c \ub0b4\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud658\uc790\uac00 \ub958\ub9c8\ud2f0\uc2a4\uad00\uc808\uc5fc(RA)\uc758 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uace8\ubbf8\ub780\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba74\uc11c 2010\ub144 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ubcd1\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4\uba74 RA\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud658\uc790\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30\uac04 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc774 \ube44\ud65c\uc131(\uce58\ub8cc \uc720\ubb34\uc5d0 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774)\uc778 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec, \ud6c4\ud5a5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 2010\ub144 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud55c \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\ub3c4 RA\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \u2020\uac10\ubcc4 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc99d\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uc804\uc2e0\uc131 \ud64d\ubc18\uc131 \ub8e8\ud478\uc2a4, \uac74\uc120\uc131 \uad00\uc808\uc5fc \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud48d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc9c8\ud658\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uac10\ubcc4\uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub958\ub9c8\ud2f0\uc2a4\uc804\ubb38\uc758\uc640 \uc0c1\uc758\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud658\uc790\uac00 \uba85\ud655\ud55c RA\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 10\uc810 \uc911 6\uc810 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.
